# Rule: Agent Change Output Format

When working on tasks, the agent must report changes in a predictable structure.

## Required output in every work response
- Files changed (paths)
- Key code blocks (C++ first → bindings → Python)
- Tests added/updated (C++ + Python)
- Benchmarks added/updated (if perf path touched)
- Brief perf/memory rationale (allocations, complexity, lifetimes)

## Goal
Make reviews easy and ensure no step (tests/bench/docs) is skipped.
